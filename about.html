    <h2>Professionally...</h2>
    <p class="about-me">I had a wonderful career as an elementary school teacher for the last thirteen years and am now eagerly seeking new professional challenges as a web developer.  During my time as a teacher, I felt increasingly drawn towards a career in technology.  This past summer, I resigned from my full-time teaching position so that I could focus on learning web development and how to write code. I enjoyed the challenges and growth I experienced as a teacher, but my focus is squarely set on moving forward to a career in technology.

    <h2>Personally...</h2>
    <p class="about-me">In addition to my professional passions for education and technology, I have many personal passions as well. I have been happily married for nineteen years and have two amazing teenage daughters.  Spending time with my family is the number one thing I enjoy. Together, we love traveling, camping, hiking, eating, playing sports and watching movies. I am also an avid reader of fiction and lately...books about coding. I love to ride my bike and play frisbee with my Australian Cattle dog. I consider myself incredibly lucky and am grateful for all I have in my life.
